# Configuration file for the OAI-PMH REST service

# The base URL under which the REST service runs.
# If you do not set this property, the base URL
# will be retrieved using javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo.getBaseUri().
# In some case though, the value returned by this
# method may be inaccurate. You must include the
# context root (the invariable path segment after
# the host/port). E.g. http://example.com/oaipmh
